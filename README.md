# ðŸ”´ GraphColoringProblem-Optimization

### Project Description:

The goal of this project is to implement and compare different optimization algorithms for solving the graph coloring problem. The problem consists of coloring the nodes of a graph such that no two adjacent nodes have the same color, while using the minimum number of colors possible.

#### ðŸ”¸ The implemented algorithms include:

<li><b>Greedy algorithm:</b> A simple approach that assigns the first available color to each node, starting from the node with the most neighbors.</li>
<li><b>Tabu search:</b> A metaheuristic algorithm that uses a tabu list to prevent the algorithm from getting stuck in local optima.</li>
<li><b>Simulated annealing:</b> A probabilistic metaheuristic algorithm that simulates the process of annealing in materials science to escape local optima.</li>
<li><b>Genetic algorithm:</b> A population-based algorithm that imitates the process of natural selection to find the optimal solution.

#### ðŸ”¸ The project consists of the following steps:

<ol>
<li>Implement the graph coloring problem as a function that takes the adjacency matrix and adjacency list of a graph as input and returns the coloring of the nodes as a dictionary.</li>
<li>Implement the different optimization algorithms as functions that take the graph coloring problem as input and return the optimal coloring of the nodes.</li>
<li>Compare the results of the different algorithms by running them on a set of test graphs and measuring the number of colors used, the execution time, and the quality of the solutions.</li> </ol>
The project will be implemented in Python and will make use of popular libraries such as <i>numpy</i>, <i>pandas</i>, <i>matplotlib</i> for data manipulation and visualization.

### ðŸ”º Requirements
<li>Python 3.x </li>
<li>Numpy</li>
<li>Matplotlib (for visualizing the results)</li>

### ðŸ”º Input

The input for the program will be an adjacency matrix and adjacency list of a graph.

### ðŸ”º Output

The output will be a dictionary containing the nodes as keys and their assigned colors as values.

### ðŸ”º Conclusion

The project will be useful for researchers and practitioners working in the field of graph theory and combinatorial optimization. It will provide a comprehensive comparison of different optimization algorithms for solving the graph coloring problem and can serve as a starting point for further research in this area.
